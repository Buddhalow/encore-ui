<p>This is an unofficial docs of the recreation  <br />of Spotify's encore ui framework in MUI</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

Some people has asked if Spotify would open up their design system to
The public like Microsoft, Google and Adobe has done. Official reps responded
They are listening to the requests but might come later.

Some generic parts of Encore UI such the rounded edges of button and a font which mininic
Spotifys one (Jakarta Sans)
