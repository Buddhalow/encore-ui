# encore-ui

A tweak of the @mui/material-ui v5 which minimic the characteristics of the Encore design system by Spotify.

# Background

Some people has asked if Spotify would open up their design system to
The publik like Microsoft, Google and Adobe has done. Official reps responded
They are listening to the requests but might come later.

In the meantime I decided to create a tweak of the mui framework which minimics
Some generic parts of Encore UI such the rounded edges of button and a font which mininic
Spotifys one (Jakarta Sans)
